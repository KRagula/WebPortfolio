# Morse Code Translator

This program was created to translate 6 pages of text written by a fellow student in Morse Code.  As he filled it with symbols with no Morse Code Translations, I had to account for this in the program.  
The program takes in text given by the user in either English or Morse Code and translates it to the other language.  A "Return" button allows switching between the functions without restarting the App.
